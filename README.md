## Are You Ready to ROCK?
The ROCm Platform brings a rich foundation to advanced computing by seamlessly
 integrating the CPU and GPU with the goal of solving real-world problems.

#### Supported CPUs
The ROCm Platform leverages PCIe Atomics (Fetch ADD, Compare and SWAP, 
Unconditional SWAP, AtomicsOpCompletion).
[PCIe atomics](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/RadeonOpenCompute.github.io/blob/master/ROCmPCIeFeatures.md)
are only supported on PCIe Gen3 Enabled CPUs and PCIe Gen3 Switches like
Broadcom PLX. When you install your GPUs make sure you install them in a fully
PCIe Gen3 x16 or x8 slot attached either directly to the CPU's Root I/O 
controller or via a PCIe switch directly attached to the CPU's Root I/O 
controller. In our experience many issues stem from trying to use consumer 
motherboards which provide Physical x16 Connectors that are electrically 
connected as e.g. PCIe Gen2 x4. This typically occurs when connecting via the 
Southbridge PCIe I/O controller. If you motherboard is part of this category,
please do not use this connector for your GPUs, if you intend to exploit ROCm.


Our GFX8 GPU's (Fiji & Polaris Family) and GFX9 (Vega)  use PCIe Gen 3 and PCIe Atomics. 

Current CPUs which support PCIe Gen3 + PCIe Atomics are: 
  * Intel Xeon E5 v3 or newer CPUs; 
  * Intel Xeon E3 v3 or newer CPUs; 
  * Intel Core i7 v4, Core i5 v4, Core i3 v4 or newer CPUs (i.e. Haswell family or newer).
  * AMD Ryzen CPUs;
  
Upcoming CPUs which will support PCIe Gen3 + PCIe Atomics are:
  * AMD Naples Server CPUs; 
  * Cavium Thunder X Server Processor. 

Experimental support for our GFX7 GPUs Radeon R9 290, R9 390, AMD FirePro S9150, S9170 note they do not support or
take advantage of PCIe Atomics. However, we still recommend that you use a CPU
from the list provided above. 

#### Not supported or very limited support under ROCm 
* We do not support ROCm with PCIe Gen 2 enabled CPUs such as the AMD Opteron,
Phenom, Phenom II, Athlon, Athlon X2, Athlon II and Older Intel Xeon and Intel
Core Architecture and Pentium CPUs.  
* We also do not support AMD Carrizo and Kaveri APU as host for compliant dGPU
 attachments.
* Thunderbolt 1 and 2 enabled GPU's are not supported by ROCm. Thunderbolt 1 & 2
are PCIe Gen2 based.
* AMD Carrizo based APUs have limited support due to OEM & ODM's choices when it
comes to some key configuration parameters. On point, we have observed that
Carrizo Laptops, AIOs and Desktop systems showed inconsistencies in exposing and
enabling the System BIOS parameters required by the ROCm stack. Before
purchasing a Carrizo system for ROCm, please verify that the BIOS provides an
option for enabling IOMMUv2. If this is the case, the final requirement is
associated with correct CRAT table support - please inquire with the OEM about 
the latter.
* AMD Merlin/Falcon Embedded System is also not currently supported by the public Repo. 
* AMD Raven Ridge APU are currently not supported 

### New Features to ROCm 1.7

#### DKMS driver installation

 * New driver installation uses Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS)
 * Only amdkfd and amdgpu kernel modules are installed to support AMD hardware
 * Currently only Debian packages are provided for DKMS (no Fedora suport available)
 * See the [ROCT-Thunk-Interface](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCT-Thunk-Interface/tree/roc-1.7.x) and [ROCK-Kernel-Driver](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/tree/roc-1.7.x) for additional documentation on driver setup

#### Developer preview of the new OpenCL 1.2 compatible language runtime and compiler

 * OpenCL 2.0 compatible kernel language support with OpenCL 1.2 compatible
   runtime 
 * Supports offline ahead of time compilation today;
   during the Beta phase we will add in-process/in-memory compilation. 
 * Binary Package support for Ubuntu 16.04
 * Binary Package support for Fedora 24 is not currently available
 * Dropping binary package support for Ubuntu 14.04, Fedora 23

#### Supported Operating Systems

The ROCm 1.7 platform has been tested on the following operating systems:
 * Ubuntu 16.04

### Installing from AMD ROCm repositories
AMD is hosting only debian repositories for the ROCm 1.7 packages at this time. It is expected
that an rpm repository will be available in the next point release.

The packages in the Debian repository have been signed to ensure package integrity.
Directions for each repository are given below:

##### First make sure your system is up to date 

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install libnuma-dev
sudo reboot
```
#### Optional: Upgrade to 4.13 kernel
Although not required, it is recommended as of ROCm 1.7.1 that the system's kernel is upgraded to the latest 4.13 version available:

```shell
sudo apt install linux-headers-4.13.0-32-generic linux-image-4.13.0-32-generic linux-image-extra-4.13.0-32-generic linux-signed-image-4.13.0-32-generic
sudo reboot 
```
#### Packaging server update
The packaging server has been changed from the old http://packages.amd.com
to the new repository site http://repo.radeon.com. 

#### Debian repository - apt

##### Add the ROCm apt repository
For Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, configure the Debian ROCm repository as
follows:

```shell
wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'
```
The gpg key might change, so it may need to be updated when installing a new 
release. The current rocm.gpg.key is not avialable in a standard key ring distribution,
but has the following sha1sum hash:

f0d739836a9094004b0a39058d046349aacc1178  rocm.gpg.key

##### Install or Update
Next, update the apt repository list and install/update the rocm package:

>**Warning**: Before proceeding, make sure to completely
>[uninstall any previous ROCm package](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#removing-pre-release-packages):

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rocm-dkms
```

###### Next set your permsions 
With move to upstreaming the KFD driver and the support of DKMS,  for all Console aka headless user, you will need to add all  your users to the  'video" group by setting the Unix permissions

Configure 
Ensure that your user account is a member of the "video" group prior to using the ROCm driver. You can find which groups you are a member of with the following command:

```shell
groups
```

To add yourself to the video group you will need the sudo password and can use the following command:

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME 
``` 

Once complete, reboot your system.

We recommend you [verify your installation](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#verify-installation) to make sure everything completed successfully.

#### To install ROCm with Developer Preview of OpenCL 

##### Start by following the instruction of installing ROCm with Debian repository:

No additional steps are required. The rocm-opencl package is now installed with rocm-dkms as a dependency. This includes the development package, rocm-opencl-dev.
 
 
###### Upon restart, To test your OpenCL instance 

 Build and run Hello World OCL app..

HelloWorld sample:
```
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgaster/opencl-book-samples/master/src/Chapter_2/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cpp
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgaster/opencl-book-samples/master/src/Chapter_2/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cl
```

 Build it using the default ROCm OpenCL include and library locations:
```
g++ -I /opt/rocm/opencl/include/ ./HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld -L/opt/rocm/opencl/lib/x86_64 -lOpenCL
```

 Run it:
 ```
 ./HelloWorld
```

##### Un-install
To un-install the entire rocm development package execute:

```shell
sudo apt autoremove rocm-dkms
```

##### Installing development packages for cross compilation
It is often useful to develop and test on different systems. In this scenario,
you may prefer to avoid installing the ROCm Kernel to your development system.

In this case, install the development subset of packages:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rocm-dev
```

>**Note:** To execute ROCm enabled apps you will require a system with the full
>ROCm driver stack installed

##### Known Issues / Workarounds

######## If you Plan to Run with X11 - we are seeing  X freezes under load

ROCm 1.7.1 a kernel parameter noretry has been set to 1 to improve overall system performance. However it has been proven to bring instability to graphics driver shipped with Ubuntu. This is an ongoing issue and we are looking into it.

Before that, please try apply this change by changing noretry bit to 0.

```shell
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/amdkfd/parameters/noretry
```

Files under /sys won't be preserved after reboot so you'll need to do it every time.

One way to keep noretry=0 is to change /etc/modprobe.d/amdkfd.conf and make it be:

options amdkfd noretry=0

Once it's done, run sudo update-initramfs -u. Reboot and verify /sys/module/amdkfd/parameters/noretry stays as 0.


##### Removing pre-release packages
If you installed any of the ROCm pre-release packages from github, they will
need to be manually un-installed:

```shell
sudo apt purge libhsakmt
sudo apt purge compute-firmware
sudo apt purge $(dpkg -l | grep 'kfd\|rocm' | grep linux | grep -v libc | awk '{print $2}')
```

If possible, we would recommend starting with a fresh OS install.

#### RPM repository - dnf (yum)

A repository containing rpm packages is currently not available for the ROCm 1.7 release.

#### Closed source components
The ROCm platform relies on a few closed source components to provide legacy
functionality like HSAIL finalization and debugging/profiling support. These
components are only available through the ROCm repositories, and will either be
deprecated or become open source components in the future. These components are
made available in the following packages:

*  hsa-ext-rocr-dev

### Getting ROCm source code
Modifications can be made to the ROCm 1.7 components by modifying the open
source code base and rebuilding the components. Source code can be cloned from
each of the GitHub repositories using git, or users can use the repo command
and the ROCm 1.7 manifest file to download the entire ROCm 1.7 source code.

#### Installing repo
Google's repo tool allows you to manage multiple git repositories
simultaneously. You can install it by executing the following commands:

```shell
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```
Note: make sure ~/bin exists and it is part of your PATH

#### Cloning the code
```shell
mkdir ROCm && cd ROCm
repo init -u https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm.git -b roc-1.7.1
repo sync
```
These series of commands will pull all of the open source code associated with
the ROCm 1.7 release. Please ensure that ssh-keys are configured for the
target machine on GitHub for your GitHub ID.

* OpenCL Runtime and Compiler will be submitted to the Khronos Group, prior to
  the final release, for conformance testing.
